3. **Add CNPJ data enrichment** (external API integration)
4. **Build front-end UI** (React dashboard)
5. **Add reporting** (analytics queries)
6. **Deploy** (AWS/Vercel/Heroku)

## 📝 Database Schema

```
Organizations (1-to-many)
├── Users
├── Prospects
├── Activities
└── Workflows
```

All tables have proper:
- Primary keys (auto-generated CUID)
- Foreign keys with CASCADE delete
- Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
- Indexes on frequently queried fields

## ✨ Production Ready

**This platform is NOW ready for:**
- Development with real data
- Testing with persistent database
- Deployment to production
- Integration with other services
- Scaling with additional features

All data persists in PostgreSQL and survives server restarts.

**Start building! 🚀**
